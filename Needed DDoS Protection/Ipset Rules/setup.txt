These ipset rules block asn's that are known to send DDoS attacks, for example AS16276(ovh) which bypasses ovh vac and is used in ovh-betav2

First we need to install ipset as such:
apt install ipset             This installation is for ubuntu
yum install ipset             This installation is for centos

Finally we have to setup ipset, as such:
ipset -N myBlackhole-4 hash:net family inet
ipset -N myBlackhole-6 hash:net family inet6
iptables -t mangle -I PREROUTING -m set --match-set myBlackhole-4 src -j DROP
ip6tables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -m set --match-set myBlackhole-6 src -j DROP

Now that that's done go block some bad asn's
